            <h2>Lionel Messi beats an egg to become most liked post on Instagram</h2>
            <p>Lionel Messi set yet another record after his Instagram post celebrating Argentina’s World Cup win became the most-liked on the platform, breaking a nearly four-year-old record held by a photo of an egg.
                Having led Argentina to their first World Cup in 36 years with victory over France, Messi proceeded to make more history off the pitch with his photo gallery on Instagram, which racked up more than 65 million likes at the time of writing.
                The previous record was famously held by a stock image of an egg on a white background with 55.7 million likes, posted by the account @world_record_egg in January 2019 in an intentional bid to become the most-liked Instagram post of all time.</p>

            <h2>Kylian Mbappe breaks silence after France World Cup final loss to Lionel Messi and Argentina</h2>
            <p>Kylian Mbappe has vowed that France will return after they were beaten on penalties in the World Cup final by Argentina.

                The 23-year-old scooped the Golden Boot and became the first player since Sir Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. Although his efforts were in vain as Lionel Scaloni's side were crowned world champions for the first time since 1986.
                
                Mbappe went toe-to-toe with his PSG teammate Lionel Messi on Sunday in the Lusail Stadium, in Qatar, as he dragged the reigning champions back into the final with a 90-second second-half double.</p>

            <p>
                This was a final that had superstar rivalries, penalties, iconic goals and goalkeeping masterclasses, culminating in Lionel Messi’s crowning as world champion after Argentina beat France on penalties.

                The pièce de resistance, a moment that will live long in the memory like an impressionistic masterpiece, is that iconic image of Messi – lifted aloft on his teammates’ shoulders – with the World Cup trophy finally in his hands.
